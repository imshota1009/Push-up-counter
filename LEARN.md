## ðŸ“¸ Pose Detection with MoveNet

This project uses **MoveNet**, a fast pose estimation model provided by TensorFlow.js.

### Key Concepts
- Pose estimation detects **17 body landmarks** (shoulders, elbows, wrists, etc.)  
- By calculating the **angle of the elbow**, we can determine if the arm is "UP" (extended) or "DOWN" (bent).  
- Repetition counting is based on detecting the transition from DOWN â†’ UP.

## ðŸŽ¥ Webcam Access with JavaScript

The app uses the **MediaDevices API** to access your camera.  

```js
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })
  .then(stream => {
    videoElement.srcObject = stream;
  });
